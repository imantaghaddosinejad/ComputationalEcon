Contains MATLAB code to globally solve Krusell and Smith (1998) with endogenous labour supply. The model is solved using the Repeated Transition Method (RTM) developed by Lee (2025). My extension is computational: I parallelize the backward solution step along the transition path to improve runtime performance.
